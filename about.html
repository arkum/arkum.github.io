"Your blog is notes to yourself. If somebody else is reading it, it is a good thing."

One of the many interesting definitions I read about what exactly a blog is. I guess this one is from Scott Hanselman. So If you are reading this, you have stumbled on my notes, and may be interested to know a little about me. 

I am Arun Kumar and I work for MOQ digital, Australia as an Azure Solution Architect.I am an ex-Microsoftie and used to work as an Architect at Microsoft. I have built Customer Care Framework and early versions of Customer Care Accelerator products for Microsoft. You can contact me at @ar_kumar on twitter
