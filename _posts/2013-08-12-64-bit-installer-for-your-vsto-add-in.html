I hope this is my last post on VSTO. I am not an expert in VSTO and I am really excited about the new app model for Office 2013, which lets you create a cleaner powerful extensions for office products like Work, Excel, Outlook and even SharePoint

However, If you are planning to create an installer for your VSTO add-in using the instructions [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/cc442767.aspx#Obtain) and deploy on a 64-bit machine it will not work.This is because the registry key is different for 64-bit machines at the step where you create a .prq XML file and add Visual Studio 2010 Tools for Office Runtime as a pre-requisite. Instead of the XML file snippet, use the following one when you create a .prq file for 64-bit machines
